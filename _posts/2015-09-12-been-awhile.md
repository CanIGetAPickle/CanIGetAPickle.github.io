## Back to Work!

I haven't been coding much at all for the last few months due to my job (*fie, for shame!* I know...). I had very little time for much of anything, and it was starting to really weigh down on me. <!--end-excerpt-->

I don't really want to discuss many details, but I was working an awful job that began taking over my life. I realized that my personal and professional relationships were being compromised, as well as my mental health, so I mustered up the courage to walk away before things got out of hand. Even after I did, I followed an intensive month-long psychological decompression plan to get myself back in the right frame of mind and repair failing relationships. Things are so much better at this point, but I still consider myself a work in progress.

Take care of yourself, and the rest will take care of itself.
